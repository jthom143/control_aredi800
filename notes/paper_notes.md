## Paper Notes: 

### March 06, 2016 
Talked with Darryn about narrowing focus for my next paper. Problem with focusing on just the aredi800 simulation and the climate response to convection is that Anna Cabre (U. Penn) is working on something similar at the moment. A more interesting course would be focusing on the differences between the aredi mixing simulations and the fact that convection can be turned off without changing the overall climatology.
