## Paper Notes: 

### March 06, 2016 
Talked with Darryn about narrowing focus for my next paper. Problem with focusing on just the aredi800 simulation and the climate response to convection is that Anna Cabre (U. Penn) is working on something similar at the moment. A more interesting course would be focusing on the differences between the aredi mixing simulations and the fact that convection can be turned off without changing the overall climatology.

About 210 years have been run out for the high GM run. This weekend work on outline of next paper, including recap of papers that use these aredi runs. Email Anand and ask to verify list of papers using aredi simulations. Outline: 
* Introduction: Motivation, previous papers using aredi simulations, hypothesis/aim of paper. 
* Methods: Breif overview of simulations used. 
* Current results: Figures of aredi 800 simulation and other simulations. 
* To do list: List of next steps to complete paper. 

Aim to email this to Darryn by Wednesday.
