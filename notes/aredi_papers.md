Results from historical-ish simulations:
Aredi 400 mixing simulation results in the least amount of anthropogenic carbon flux by the ocean (2.4 Gt/yr in finaligures 2a and b). Aberzonal and Aber2D lateral mixing estimates lie between these two extreme simulations. Low lateral mixing coefficient in Souther Ocean is more important than the high values in the gyre interior with respect to carbon flux.

Consistent with the carbon flux, the total inventory of anthropogenic carbon (at year 1995) is largest for the Aredi 2400 simulation (118.7 GtC) and smallest for the Aredi 400 simulation (102 GtC) with the Abernathy estimates falling between the two. This range is about half of the variability across the CMIP5 models, with these estimates being at the higher end.

Doubling CO2 simulations:
Including the circulation changes due to changes is radiative forcing in the instantaneous doubling CO2 simulation, the spatial pattern of carbon storage remains the same as the biological-only historical simulation. In the Aredi 400 mixing simulation, the primary region of anthropogenic carbon storage is in the N. Atlantic. As the mixing parameter increases, more anthropogenic carbon is stored in the N. Pacific. This increased storage is due to the higher mixing destabilizing the halocline and allows old waters to come up to the surface and take up anthropogenic carbon (NOT SHOWN). year  the historical trajectory with respect to air-sea fluxes, but not to radiation. 

Key Points: 
Carbon uptake varies significantly across historical model simulations that use different constant values of the lateral mixing coefficient, Aredi. The highest carbon uptake occurs in a simulation that uses a high mixing coefficient (2400m^2s^-1), while the lowest carbon uptake occurs in the simulation that uses a low coefficient (400 m^2s^-1). Under instantaneous doubling CO2 simulations, there is a 21% range in carbon uptake across the aredi simulations.

Model Runs:   
* AREDI800: 1500 years, pre-industrial GHGs and aerosols, Aredi = 800, (not sure about ozone)  
* AREDI400: 500 years, pre-industrial GHGs and aerosols, Aredi = 400  
* AREDI1200: 500 years, pre-industrial GHGs and aerosols,  Aredi = 1200  
* AREDI2400: 500 years, pre-industrial GHGs and aerosols,  Aredi = 2400  

Results:   
Bulk of the changes occur in the first 50 years of each run. The last 100 years are used to establish a climatology. 

As Aredi changes, there are associated changes in surface air temperature (SAT), sea surface temperature (SST), air temperature over land, absorbed short-wave radiation, outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR), and precipitation. As Aredi increases, the oceanic and land temperatures and precipitation increase as well. This is due to an increase in the absorbed short wave radiation. The bulk of these changes occur over the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean. 

This high-latitude warming can be explained in-part by an increase in the diffusive pole-ward heat transport as Aredi is increased. This increase in poleward heat transport by neutral diffusions in opposed, however, but a decrease in advective pole-ward heat transport, resulting in a very small increase in total pole-ward heat transport. 

The changes in radatiave fluxes are much larger than the changes in pole-ward ocean heat transport. In the higher mixing simulation, more shortwave radiation is absorbed by the ocean. In the mid-latitudes and tropics (40S-40N), changes is cloud cover are responsible for the increase in shortwave radiation entering the ocean. In the high latitudes, espically the Southern Ocean, the increase in shortwave absorbtion is due to decreases in ice cover. 

The reduction of sea ice causes the high-latitude oceans to warm, but the reduction of sea ice is a result of vertical heat transport in the Southern Ocean via convection. During higher mixing cases, the polar halocline is weaker, thus allowing more warm, higher temperature waters to come to the surface (i.e. convection). This decrease in the strength of the polar halocline is due it an increase in pole-ward salt transport through neutral diffusion in the higher mixing simulation. 

Key Points: 
Changing the Aredi parameterization in the GFDL ESM2Mc model has a significant impact on sea surface temperature (SST). When the lateral mixing coefficient is increased to 2400 m^2s^-1, the global SST increases by about 1C relative to a low mixing coefficient (400 m^2s^-1), but stronger warming occurs regionally. Increasing the along-isopycnal mixing coefficient results in an increase in pole-ward salt transport through neutral diffusion in the top few hundred meters of the water column. This increase in pole-ward transport of salt results in the polar surface waters getting saltier, therefore decreasing the strength of the polar halocline and allowing more warm waters to reach the surface from the sub-surface. These warm waters melt the sea ice, and results in more shortwave radiation absorbtion by the ocean, thus warming the polar oceans by a significant amount.
