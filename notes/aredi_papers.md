#### Gnanadesikan et al, 2015: Isopycnal mixing by mesoscale eddies significantly impacts oceanic anthropogenic carbon uptake.

Model runs:
* AREDI800: 1500 years, pre-industrial GHGs and aerosols, Aredi = 800, (not sure about ozone)
* AREDI400: 360 years, pre-industrial GHGs and aerosols, Aredi = 400
* AREDI1200: 360 years, pre-industrial GHGs and aerosols,  Aredi = 1200
* AREDI2400: 360 years, pre-industrial GHGs and aerosols,  Aredi = 2400

* ABER2D: Simulation using the spatially dependent distribution of the mixing coefficient from Abernathy and Marshall, 2013 with values ranging between 100-5500*
* ABERZONAL: Zonally averaged version of ABER2D*

* Historical Runs: Atmospheric CO2 followsng the impacts of circulation.

Doubling CO2 runs: Atmospheric CO2 is doubled to 572 ppmv for both the air-sea fluxes and radiation schemes.

Results from historical-ish simulations:
Aredi 400 mixing simulation results in the least amount of anthropogenic carbon flux by the ocean (2.4 Gt/yr in finaligures 2a and b). Aberzonal and Aber2D lateral mixing estimates lie between these two extreme simulations. Low lateral mixing coefficient in Souther Ocean is more important than the high values in the gyre interior with respect to carbon flux.

Consistent with the carbon flux, the total inventory of anthropogenic carbon (at year 1995) is largest for the Aredi 2400 simulation (118.7 GtC) and smallest for the Aredi 400 simulation (102 GtC) with the Abernathy estimates falling between the two. This range is abou\
t half of the variability across the CMIP5 models, with these estimates being at the higher end.

Doubling CO2 simulations:
Including the circulation changes due to changes is radiative forcing in the instantaneous doubling CO2 simulation, the spatial pattern of carbon storage remains the same as the biological-only historical simulation. In the Aredi 400 mixing simulation, the primary regi\
on of anthropogenic carbon storage is in the N. Atlantic. As the mixing parameter increases, more anthropogenic carbon is stored in the N. Pacific. This increased storage is due to the higher mixing destabilizing the halocline and allows old waters to come up to the su\
rface and take up anthropogenic carbon (NOT SHOWN). year  the historical trajectory with respect to air-sea fluxes, but not to radiation.
