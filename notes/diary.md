Diary of every day work for ESM2Mc Aredi = 800 control run. 

### March 04, 2016
Achieved flux closure for single point in Southern Ocean. Will work tomorrow on algorithm for calculating heat flux closure for every point (may limit domain to Southern Hemisphere). 

### March 06, 2016
Putting flux analysis on hold for a little while. Met with Anand and Darryn briefly after group meeting and talked about narrowing focus for next paper. Planning to meet with Darryn early next week with outline for next two papers/projects. 

Now working on updating/organizing control_aredi800 project. Datascope is down - can't access raw data. Work on summarizing Aredi papers in the mean time. 

### March 07, 2016
Created functions for calculating OHC and OCC (python/calc_OHC_OCC.py). Re-created figure 2 from proposal to make sure all is working well. Now going to work on quantifying convective events. Pick three strongest convective events and do analysis for all three: 
* Maps of convective region (quantify duration, area, average mld depth) 
* Ocean carbon and heat as a function of latitude.  
* Subsurface carbon and heat with latitude. 

Aim to finish this analysis by Saturday evening. 

Tonight: work on outlining next paper.
