Diary of every day work for ESM2Mc Aredi = 800 control run.

### April 04, 2016
Achieved flux closure for single point in Southern Ocean. Will work tomorrow on algorithm for calculating heat flux closure for every point (may limit domain to Southern Hemisphere).

### April 06, 2016
Putting flux analysis on hold for a little while. Met with Anand and Darryn briefly after group meeting and talked about narrowing focus for next paper. Planning to meet with Darryn early next week with outline for next two papers/projects.

Now working on updating/organizing control_aredi800 project. Datascope is down - can't access raw data. Work on summarizing Aredi papers in the mean time.

### April 07, 2016
Created functions for calculating OHC and OCC (python/calc_OHC_OCC.py). Re-created figure 2 from proposal to make sure all is working well. Now going to work on quantifying convective events. Pick three strongest convective events and do analysis for all three:
* Maps of convective region (quantify duration, area, average mld depth)
* Ocean carbon and heat as a function of latitude.  
* Subsurface carbon and heat with latitude.

Aim to finish this analysis by Saturday evening.

Tonight: work on outlining next paper.


### April 13, 2016
Talked with Darryn about next aredi paper. He suggested instead of focusing on the effect of changing aredi, focus on the difference in global vs Southern Ocean heat and carbon signals in the different model runs and the different convective variability.

Next couple of steps:
1. Make plots of global and Southern ocean heat and carbon content for all simulations.

### April 20, 2016
Have been working on the linear correlation between Weddell Sea MLD and global/SH ocean heat content. Presented These correlations at the group meeting with little success. Need to figure out what the QUESTION is I'm asking. Will work on this tomorrow. 

### April 22, 2016
Met with Darryn to talk about refining my question and lay out the next steps leading up to a paper.  
**What causes ocean heat and carbon content variability in GFDL ESM2Mc?**   
First few steps:   
1. Plot global OHC and OCC timeseries for each simulation. Break up the world oceans into ~5 different regions and plot the OHC/OCC. This will help identify which regions are causing the variability.  
2. Look into detrending process used for the 400 and 2400 simulations. Is my detrending causing the century-scale variability seen in the global heat and carbon?   
3. First work on the carbon content and put together a picture of what is going on (i.e. convection causes SO variability which swamps global signal...).  
4. Then work on heat content and put together crude picture of mechanisms causing variability.  

Aim for paper draft by end of May?
