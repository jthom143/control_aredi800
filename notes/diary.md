Diary of every day work for ESM2Mc Aredi = 800 control run. 

## March 04, 2016
Achieved flux closure for single point in Southern Ocean. Will work tomorrow on algorithm for calculating heat flux closure for every point (may limit domain to Southern Hemisphere). 

## March 05, 2016
Branched repository to work on energy balance on larger domain (branch called: 'scale_up_flux_analysis')
Worked on scaling up energy balance. Not working yet (Sum of fluxes does not equal temp tendency). Continue working later tonight or tomorrow. Try calculating energy balance for multiple grid points and then average or sum.
