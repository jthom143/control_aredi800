Title: 

Main Message: Strong anti-correlation between global and southern-ocean heat content. Most noticable during convective events. Likely due to an atmospheric feedback response. 

Introduction: 
- Motivation: DeLavergne et al, 2013? 
- Important to understand the natural variability 

Results: 
 - Ocean heat and carbon content timeseries (aredi=800) figure. 
  - Global heat content is out of phase with southern ocean? **Why?**
  - This relationship is most apparent during convective events, but sems to persist throughout the timeseries. 

- In order to understand this relationship better, break timeseries down into 3 periods of strong Weddell Sea Deep Convection. 
- Subsurface heat and carbon figures with latitude (for time periods 1, 2, and 5) --> maybe just show the upper 2000m? 
  - Shows a strong heat and carbon depletion in the southern ocean during convection. 
  - Also shows strong heating in the mid-latitudes and tropics.
