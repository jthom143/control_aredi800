# Paper Outline 

## Introduction: 
### Motivation: 
Ocean carbon and heat uptake and storage are very important processes in regulating the s climate. As shown in Frolicher et al. (2015) there is considerable uncertainty in carbon and heat uptake and storage as represented by CMIP5 models, especially in the Southern Ocean. A further complicating factor is open ocean deep convection in the Weddell Sea. Often referred to as the Weddell polynya, these deep convective events are important for the formation of Antarctic Bottom water and the global heat and carbon budget (Killworth, 1983). Climate models simulate deep convection oscillations to varying degrees and frequencies (de Lavergne et al., 2014); however, with few observational constraints it is difficult to determine how well modeling groups represent Southern Ocean dynamics.
