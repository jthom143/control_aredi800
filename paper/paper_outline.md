# Paper Outline 

## Introduction: 
### Motivation: 
Ocean carbon and heat uptake and storage are very important processes in regulating the s climate. As shown in Frolicher et al. (2015)
Doubling CO2 runs: Atmospheric CO2 is doubled to 572 ppmv for both the air-sea fluxes and radiation schemes. 

Results:

Results from historical-ish simulations: 
Aredi 400 mixing simulation results in the least amount of anthropogenic carbon flux by the ocean (2.4 Gt/yr in final
Consistent with the carbon flux, the total inventory of anthropogenic carbon (at year 1995) is largest for the Aredi 2400 simulation (118.7 GtC) and smallest for the Aredi 400 simulation (102 GtC) with the Abernathy estimates falling between the two. This range is about half of the variability across the CMIP5 models, with these estimates being at the higher end.  

Doubling CO2 simulations:
Including the circulation changes due to changes is radiative forcing in the instantaneous doubling CO2 simulation, the spatial pattern of carbon storage remains the same as the biological-only historical simulation. In the Aredi 400 mixing simulation, the primary region of anthropogenic carbon storage is in the N. Atlantic. As the mixing parameter increases, more anthropogenic carbon is stored in the N. Pacific. This increased storage is due to the higher mixing destabilizing the halocline and allows old waters to come up to the surface and take up anthropogenic carbon (NOT SHOWN).
 year  there is considerable uncertainty in carbon and heat uptake and storage as represented by CMIP5 models, especially in the Southern Ocean. A further complicating factor is open ocean deep convection in the Weddell Sea. Often referred to as the Weddell polynya, these deep convective events are important for the formation of Antarctic Bottom water and the global heat and carbon budget (Killworth, 1983). Climate models simulate deep convection oscillations to varying degrees and frequencies (de Lavergne et al., 2014); however, with few observational constraints it is difficult to determine how well modeling groups represent Southern Ocean dynamics.


### Previous papers using aredi simulation suite:

The following papers have used these piControl aredi simulations and came to the following conclusions: 
1. Gnanadesikan et al, 2015: Isopycnal mixing by mesoscale eddies significantly impacts oceanic anthropogenic carbon uptake
Model runs: 
AREDI800: 1500 years, pre-industrial GHGs and aerosols, Aredi = 800, (not sure about ozone)
AREDI400: 360 years, pre-industrial GHGs and aerosols, Aredi = 400
AREDI1200: 360 years, pre-industrial GHGs and aerosols,  Aredi = 1200
AREDI2400: 360 years, pre-industrial GHGs and aerosols,  Aredi = 2400

ABER2D: Simulation using the spatially dependent distribution of the mixing coefficient from Abernathy and Marshall, 2013 with values ranging between 100-5500* 

ABERZONAL: Zonally averaged version of ABER2D*

Historical Runs: Atmospheric CO2 follows the historical trajectory with respect to air-sea fluxes, but not to radiation.
